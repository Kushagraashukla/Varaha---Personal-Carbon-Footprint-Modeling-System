# Varaha---Personal-Carbon-Footprint-Modeling-System
Varaha is the cosmic protector in Hindu mythologyâ€”an incarnation of Vishnu who embodies resilience and restoration,who lifted the Earth from chaos and restored balance and rescued the Earth from destruction.
This project is the initial step towards building a Machine Learning model that predicts a person's average carbon footprint over a given duration (week or month).
